          *Available for Qualified Purchasers only. Qualified Purchasers receive
          an Apple&nbsp;Gift&nbsp;Card when they purchase an Eligible Product at
          a Qualifying Location through September 30, 2024. Gift card values may
          vary by Eligible Product. Only one Apple&nbsp;Gift&nbsp;Card per
          Eligible Product per Qualified Purchaser. Offer subject to
          availability. While supplies last. Qualified Purchasers shall receive
          a discount equal to the value of the Apple&nbsp;Gift&nbsp;Card off the
          price of the Eligible Product, but will be charged for all items in
          their cart, including the Apple&nbsp;Gift&nbsp;Card. Important notice
          regarding the checkout receipt and monthly statement for
          Apple&nbsp;Card Monthly Installments (ACMI) purchases with this
          promotion: Qualified Purchasers selecting ACMI (a 0% APR payment
          option available only in the U.S.) as payment type at checkout shall
          receive a discount equal to the value of the Apple&nbsp;Gift&nbsp;Card
          off the price of the Eligible Product. This will result in one ACMI
          installment plan over 12 months for the Eligible Product discounted by
          the instant credit, and a second ACMI installment plan over 12 months
          for the full price of the Apple&nbsp;Gift&nbsp;Card. The total
          combined amount charged over the two separate ACMI installment plans
          will reflect the original full retail price of the Eligible Product.
          Separately, Qualified Purchasers will receive and be charged for the
          Apple&nbsp;Gift&nbsp;Card in the amount of the applicable discount off
          the Eligible Product. Apple&nbsp;Card Monthly Installments (ACMI) is a
          0% APR payment option that is only available if you select it at
          checkout in the U.S. for eligible products purchased at
          Apple&nbsp;Store locations, <a href="/">apple.com</a>, the
          Apple&nbsp;Store app, or by calling 1-800-MY-APPLE, and is subject to
          credit approval and credit limit. See
          <a

            >support.apple.com/kb/HT211204</a
          >
          for more information about eligible products. APR ranges may vary
          based on when you accepted an Apple&nbsp;Card. Cardholders who accept
          an Apple&nbsp;Card on and or after August 1, 2024: Variable APRs for
          Apple&nbsp;Card, other than ACMI, range from 19.24% to 29.49% based on
          creditworthiness. Rates as of August 1, 2024. Existing cardholders:
          See your Customer Agreement for applicable rates and fee. If you buy
          an ACMI-eligible product by choosing to pay in full with
          Apple&nbsp;Card (instead of using ACMI), that purchase is subject to
          the Apple&nbsp;Card variable APR, not 0% APR. Taxes and shipping on
          ACMI purchases are subject to the variable APR, not 0% APR. When you
          buy an iPhone with ACMI, you’ll need to select AT&amp;T, T-Mobile, or
          Verizon as your carrier when you check out. An iPhone purchased with
          ACMI is always unlocked, so you can switch carriers at any time. ACMI
          is not available for purchases made online at the following special
          stores: Apple Employee Purchase Plan; participating corporate Employee
          Purchase Programs; Apple at Work for small businesses; Government and
          Veterans and Military Purchase Programs; or on refurbished devices.
          The last month’s payment for each product will be the product’s
          purchase price, less all other payments at the monthly payment amount.
          ACMI financing is subject to change at any time for any reason,
          including but not limited to installment term lengths and eligible
          products. See
